# 📘 University Projects – README

## 🎯 Overview
This repository contains projects developed during my master’s program at the University of Utah. The work focuses on **semantic modeling, relational paradigms, and applied analytics workflows**. Each project demonstrates how technical outputs can be translated into **manager‑friendly, actionable rules** that create real business value.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`project-name/`** – Folder for each project, with source code and documentation.  
- **`data/`** – Sample datasets.  
- **`notebooks/`** – Jupyter or R notebooks for exploratory analysis.  
- **`docs/`** – Technical documentation and reports.  
- **`README.md`** – High‑level overview of all projects.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL** – Schema design, transformations, and queries.  
- **R / tidymodels** – Statistical modeling and machine learning workflows.  
- **YAML / Config files** – Modular rule system design.  
- **Git** – Version control and reproducible workflows.

## 📑 Key Projects
| Project | Description | Tools |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **VIP Discount Rules** | Semantic modeling of discount logic with strict schema fidelity | SQL |
| **Daily Product Discounts** | Manager‑friendly rule definitions for operational clarity | YAML |
| **Churn Modeling** | Predictive modeling using tidymodels | R |
| **Immigration Scenario Modeling** | Stress‑testing rules and mapping contingencies | SQL |
